Hi, Iâ€™m @nettnikl, currently working student in Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend/mixed development and devops as well as cybersecurity!
- âœ¨ Open for any technology stack - as long as it fits.
  I'm an alrounder, however my usual tools include Java/Kotlin, Golang, Python (some other langauages i speak are german + english), Docker or K8s for deployment.
