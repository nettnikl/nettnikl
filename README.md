Hi, Iâ€™m @nettnikl, currently working student in Germany.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in back end/mixed development and dev ops as well as cybersecurity!
- âœ¨ Open for any technology stack, as long as it fits the task. I'm an all-rounder, but my usual/preferred tools include Java/Kotlin, Golang, Python (some other languages I speak are German and English), and for deployment Docker or K8s.
